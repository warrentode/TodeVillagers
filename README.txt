Rewriting this mod from the ground up since the original has a byte code error that I don't understand and don't know
where it's coming from when you try to connect to a server with it. So I don't even know where I should be looking to
correct the problem. Hopefully if I rewrite and test this, one feature at a time, I can resolve and fix the problem.

This is what I get for not testing it in a server environment as I went. I shouldn't have assumed that because it worked
just fine in a single player environment that this would hold true for a multiplayer environment as well. I have one other
mod with a server connection problem that I need to do the same for, but the error I get for that mod is different.

So anyway, rambling aside, that's why this repository exists for now. Once I get this mod working correctly for both
client and server, I will overwrite the original repository with the working version and delete this repository.

Just making them separate repositories for now to help preserve my own sanity in how I organize things in my head
- which tends to be a mess anyhow.
